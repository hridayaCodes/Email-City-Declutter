**Introducing Email City Declutter: The Gamified Email Management Platformer That Turns Inbox Overwhelm Into an Adventure**

*Revolutionary 2D platformer transforms email management into an engaging dungeon-crawling experience, helping students and professionals conquer email overload*

**[Date]** – Today marks the launch of Email City Declutter, an innovative email management game that reimagines the mundane task of email triage as an immersive medieval dungeon adventure. Born from the Figma Make-a-thon, Email City Declutter combines classic platformer mechanics with practical productivity tools to help users—especially college students—tackle their overflowing inboxes in a fun, engaging way.

### The Problem: Email Overload is Crushing Productivity

College students and young professionals receive hundreds of emails weekly—promotional offers, assignment reminders, financial notices, social updates, and spam—creating overwhelming digital clutter that leads to missed opportunities and increased stress. Traditional email interfaces feel like work, causing users to avoid necessary inbox maintenance until it becomes unmanageable.

### The Solution: Adventure Meets Productivity

Email City Declutter transforms email management into a 2D platformer adventure inspired by beloved games like Fireboy and Watergirl. Players navigate through a medieval dungeon landscape where:

- **Buildings represent email categories** (Spam, Promotions, Orders, Sales, Research, Social, Updates, Newsletters, Personal, Gaming) rendered in detailed pixel art stone brick textures with glowing torches and illuminated windows
- **Floors serve as subcategories**, featuring wooden plank platforms with one-way mechanics that allow jumping up but not falling through
- **Email blocks appear as themed pixel art objects**—red tattered scrolls for spam, sealed letters with wax for promotions, heart notes for social emails, golden scrolls for newsletters, and purple game cartridges for gaming notifications
- **Interactive gameplay** lets users click on email blocks to open modals displaying full email content, then decide whether to delete (throw into the animated fire pit incinerator) or save (push into the golden treasure chest portal)

### Key Features

- **Pixel Art Aesthetic**: Complete dark dungeon theme with stone brick buildings, wooden platforms, flickering torches, animated lava pits, and a starry parallax-scrolling background
- **Intuitive Controls**: Click to read emails, use arrow keys to navigate, and physically interact with email objects through platformer mechanics
- **Visual Feedback**: Particle destruction animations when emails are deleted, glowing effects, and dynamic flame animations
- **Responsive Design**: Smooth camera scrolling that follows the player past the halfway point, eliminating overflow issues
- **Realistic Email Content**: Mock emails representing real student experiences—career opportunities, financial alerts, assignment deadlines, class announcements

### Real Impact for Real Users

> "Email City Declutter turned my most dreaded task into something I actually look forward to. Instead of avoiding my 200+ unread emails, I spent an hour exploring the dungeon and came out with a clean inbox. It didn't feel like work—it felt like playing."
